# McLightingHTML
McLighting web interface with 3 color support.

I re-wrote [McLightingUI v2](https://github.com/toblum/McLightingUI) in pure javascript. (No external libraries, no Vue.js)
Only the favicon and google Material Icons are imported externally.
This makes the index.htm file about 10x smaller.

The interface supports 3 colors.
At the time of writing the original [McLighting](https://github.com/toblum/McLighting) does not support 2nd or 3rd color.
To use 3 color support, get [McLighting from my repo](https://github.com/AvanOsch/McLighting)

I also added simple language support.
Currently only English and Dutch.
It should be easy to add your own language, and you can change any text in the interface by editing the Javascript "language" object.

You can also set various colors to personilize the interface.
